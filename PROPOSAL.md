# Project Proposal: MineSweeper

This project will take inspiration from the well-known 
game MineSweeper and one of the past assignments Mineopoly.

### Objective:
The objective of this game is to clear the board that has hidden bombs by 
using clues from the neighboring tiles and reach the highest score.
The score can be achieved through mining hidden gems. 

### Background Knowledge:
I will need to familiarize myself with the frontend aspect, including Cinder, of this project as I have little
experience with the display portion. I want to do this project because I used to play this game in my childhood and
would love to recreate it with a twist. 

### Timeline:
For week one, I will familiarize myself with Cinder and the frontend aspect. By week two, I will have implemented 
the mode with the timer. By week three, I will have implemented the mode with the gems and the README. Throughout the three weeks, I will
be testing every new feature that is added. 

### "Stretch" Goals:
Different levels of bombs: some that end the game, some that lower your score or add time to your time counter;
Different levels of gems: some that have a higher value than others;
An additional mode where the player has solve the puzzle as a maze instead of simply revealing the bombs;
